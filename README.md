# NYC Bike Sharing Analysis

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to determine how to create a successful bike sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa using the bike sharing data from New York City. 

## Summary

Various  interactive visualizations were created to present the data in a way that is easy to understand.

#### Top trip starting and ending locations
According to the maps below, the highest concentration of users are in the island of Manhattan. This can be attributed to population density in this part of the city.

#### Trip Duration
The following visualizations show that users are checking out bikes for less than 10 to 15 minutes at a time and that the majority of users are male. Less than half of users are female but the female users do use the bikes for a slightly longer period then male users.

## Conclusion
Based on the New York City data, in order to create a successful bike share program in Iowa, the program should place the bikes in downtown areas where there is a higher population density and where people go to work. The program should be marketed more to the female population and perhaps incentives offered to females to increase use. Incentives should also be offered during the weekend to increase use. Other visualizations that can be created in the future should find out whether the data shows if there is a relationship between checkout times, bike safety and gender.
